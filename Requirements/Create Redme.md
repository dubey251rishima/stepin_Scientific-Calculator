Scientific Calculator

Introduction

The Scientific Calculator project in C is a consoled based application Created using C programming language.
This System is a Simple mini project and Compiled in VS Codes Both on Windows and Linux operating System using GCC compiler.
A fully featured Scientific Calculator with proper operator precedence is implemented, including trigonometry functions and logarithms,
Factorials, hex, octal, binary and bitwise logical operators


SWOT Analysis

*1 Strength
   The ultimate strength of the Calculators is its innovative and user-friendly.
   Most of the maths problems can be solved using this calculator.
   
*2 WEAKNESSES
   The calculator which we are making does not perform all sort of problem such trigonometric functions.
   It can perform only 10 types of functions.
   
*3 OPPORTUNITIES  
   We have the opportunities to increase the number of functions.
   
*4 THREATS
   The calculator can be stuck in a infinite loop sometime.
   
  
Features:
-It computes several operations between -999 , 9999 range.
-It can show negative and float numbers
-Calculations that you can operate;
addition, subtraction, multiplication, divison, log, ln, sqrt, power, sin, cos, tan, cot, pi
